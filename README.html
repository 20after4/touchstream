<h3>Introduction</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;">touchstream</span> is a program that
allows you to share a keyboard &amp;
mouse over a number of machines, on a LAN, typicaly.<br>
Imagine having a mac and a linux machine, with their own screens; you
can use the Mac mouse and keyboard on the linux box too by moving the
mouse pointer to a max screen edge, and it starts moving on the linux
screen.<br>
Also, the clipboard is exchanged as you switch back &amp; forth.<br>
<br>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
The goal of <span style="font-style: italic;">touchstream</span> was
to replace <span style="font-style: italic;">synergy</span> -- at
least on my desk. <span style="font-style: italic;">Synergy</span> has
various
issues, notably on the bloat department; "powertop" flags it as one of
the most used/busy process on the machine, even tho it technicaly
hasn't a
lot to do, furthermore the codebase is bloated too, and the
implementation uses countless locks, mutexes and other distasteful
things that adds a lot of overhead, and that one doesn't strictly need
if designing the execution path properly.<br>
The other reason is that <span style="font-style: italic;">synergy</span>
stopped working on my configuration recently for
me, and I realised about it's code bloat when I went to try to fix it. <br>
<br>
Obviously, quite a bit of the platform specific bits of <span
 style="font-style: italic;">touchstream</span> are copied straight out
of <span style="font-style: italic;">synergy's</span> source code, and
not only deserve the credit, but also share their GPL licence. In many
cases, the code has been entirely reworked tho, and I haven't taken
care of copying the attribution and copyrights for individual snipets.<br>
The actualy "core" of touchstream is entirely original, and thats why
the files uses my generic GPL header bits.<br>
<h3>Status</h3>
Anyway, <span style="font-style: italic;">touchstream</span> is C99,
doesn't use a single mutex, and works for
now on OSX as a server (read, the screen that has the keyboard and
mouse) and as a client of a
recent xorg.<br>
It also can work without a "client" process by talking directly to
remote xorg servers, as long as 1) the server allows tcp connections,
and 2) you have disabled access control (xhost +)<br>
Clearly it lacks a lot of the feature <span style="font-style: italic;">synergy</span>
has (windows support, non-latin keyboard support etc) but it also a LOT
simpler, and uses a fraction of the resources.<br>
